                                 FINAL REPORT
 PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Right temporal hematoma status post evacuation, rule
 out arteriovenous malformation.

 PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  Right common carotid artery arteriogram, right external
 carotid artery arteriogram, right internal carotid artery arteriogram, left
 common carotid artery arteriogram, left external carotid artery arteriogram,
 left internal carotid artery arteriogram, left vertebral artery arteriogram,
 right common femoral artery arteriogram and Angio-Seal closure of right common
 femoral artery puncture site.

 ANESTHESIA: The patient was already intubated and on a propofol drip and she
 came down from the ICU.  An ICU nurse monitored the patient while the patient
 was in angiogram.

 DETAILS OF PROCEDURE:  The patient was brought to the angiography suite.  IV
 sedation was given.  Following this, both groins were prepped and draped in a
 sterile fashion.  We now gained access to the right common femoral artery
 using a Seldinger technique and a 5 French vascular sheath was placed in the
 right common femoral artery.  We now catheterized the above-mentioned vessels
 and AP, lateral filming was done.  This failed to reveal an aneurysm,
 arteriovenous malformation, or dural AV fistula.  There was no evidence of
 vasculitis.  A right common femoral artery arteriogram was done and a 6 French
 Angio-Seal was used for closure of the right common femoral artery puncture
 site.

 FINDINGS:  Left common carotid artery arteriogram failed to reveal any
 stenosis at the bifurcation.

 Left internal carotid artery arteriogram shows filling of the left internal
 carotid artery along the cervical, petrous, cavernous, and supraclinoid
 portion.  Both anterior and middle cerebral arteries are seen well with no
 evidence of aneurysms or arteriovenous malformation.  There is a prominent

 posterior communicating artery which flash fills the PCA territory.  All
 sinuses are patent and seen well.

 Left external carotid artery arteriogram shows normal filling of the left
 external carotid artery with no evidence of dural AV fistula.

 Right common carotid artery arteriogram shows filling of the right carotid
 bifurcation with no evidence of stenosis.

  The right internal carotid artery fills well along the cervical, petrous,
 cavernous, and supraclinoid portion.  There was no evidence of arteriovenous
 malformation.  Specifically, there was no dural AV fistula.

   Left external carotid artery arteriogram shows no evidence of dural AV
 fistula.  The left vertebral artery arteriogram shows filling of the left
 vertebral artery, the basilar artery, and both posterior cerebral arteries.
 There is no evidence of excessive vascularity in the area of the right
 hemispheric hemorrhage.

 Right common femoral artery arteriogram shows widely patent right common
 femoral artery.

 IMPRESSION:  [**Known firstname 2881**] [**Known lastname 1280**] underwent cerebral angiography which failed to
 reveal a source of the right hemispheric hemorrhage.  Specifically, no
 aneurysms, AVMs or dural AV fistula or vasculitis was identified during this
 angiogram.

Family meeting held with [**Last Name (LF) 32**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] Z., NP and this writer. [**Doctor First Name **] gave information regarding babies' progress and requirements for discharge. Dad asked several questions which were answered. Mom remained quiet but attentive through much of the meeting. She became tearful when attention was drawn to her, and there was acknowledgment of all she has been through with pregnancy and bedrest, and how overwhelming NICU and having premature babies can be, especially initially.

Both [**Doctor First Name 32**] state that they have little experience with babies and mom expressed need for support around learning to hold, care for infants.

Impressions: First time [**Doctor First Name 32**] of premature twins, with hx of infertility and a miscarriage. Mom appearing quietly overwhelmed with having had these babies and having them in NICU. Dad seeming more confident and comfortable at this point in time.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CT OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST [**2107-11-2**].

 HISTORY:  Status post cardiac catheterization, now with severe back pain.
 Assess for a retroperitoneal bleed.

 TECHNIQUE:  Helically-acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
 lung bases to the pubic symphysis without the administration of IV contrast.

 CT OF ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  The lung bases show bibasilar atelectasis
 with a probable calcified granuloma within the posterior right lung base. Also
 noted are multiple cardiac stents.  The liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas,
 adrenal glands, and visualized loops of large/small bowel are normal.  Noted
 is mild calcification of the distal abdominal aorta and proximal iliac
 arteries. There is a small amount of residual contrast within the proximal
 renal collecting systems.  The kidneys are otherwise normal in appearance.
 There is no retroperitoneal fluid collection seen.  The visualized soft
 tissues and subcutaneous regions are normal.

 CT OF PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  Residual IV contrast  is seen within a
 well-distended urinary bladder. The prostate, rectum, and unopacified loops of
 bowel are normal.  There are no abnormal fluid collections within the
 visualized pelvis or soft tissues. Noted is some soft- tissue stranding in the
 region of the right groin, consistent with the patient's stated history of a
 recent cardiac catheterization.  There is also the suggestion of a fat-
 containing right inguinal hernia and a possible right-sided hydrocele.

 The visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.

 IMPRESSION:
 1) No evidence of a retroperitoneal bleed.
 2) Mild calcification of the distal aorta and proximal iliac arteries, as
 described above.
 3) Probable fat-containing right inguinal hernia.

 The findings were discussed with the house staff caring for the patient at the
 time of the examination.

   Assessment and Plan
 FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA)
 HYPOPHOSPHATEMIA (LOW PHOSPHATE)
   24 year old man with a history of episodic dizziness, h/o pneumothorax
   who was admitted for fever and hypotension with good response to fluid
   resuscitation but persistently elevated temperature and findings on
   CXR.
    1) FEVER, TACHYCARDIA, AND HYPOTENSION. Met SIRS criteria for fever
   and tachycardia. Since admission, T up to 101.2,  not tachycardic, SBPs
   down to 77 but generally in 110s.  Persistent sore throat, rhinorrhea,
   headache, and nausea, with continued patchy opacities on CXR. Although
   viral infection/ influenza is the most likely cause, the differential
   diagnosis continues to be bacterial pneumonia and viral meningitis.
   Currently treated empirically for community-acquired PNA (ceftriaxone
   and azithromycin), with ceftriaxone dosed for meningitis coverage. If
   isolation of [**Doctor Last Name **] in sputum or if flu swab is positive, can de-escalte
   ceftriaxone from meningitis dosing. If fevers continue to spike and
   alternate source is not identified, revisit option of LP with the
   patient and continue empiric treatment for meningitis.
   -Repeat CXR this afternoon.
   -Continue azithromycin and cetriaxone (day 1 and 2 of 7, respectively)
   for community-acquired PNA
   -Acetaminophen for T>38F.
   -Follow up blood cultures, urine culture, sputum sample, and flu swab.
   2.) HYPOTENSION. SBP generally 110s since admission following 5 L IVF.
   The differential diagnosis includes vasodilation in association with
   SIRS +/- volume depletion. No signs of acute blood loss; Hct likely low
   due to hemodilution (WBC and platelets also low). At this point, his BP
   is maintained with IVF, but consider pressors for MAP <60.
   -IVF for SBP<90 or signs of poor perfusion.
   -Trend Hct.
   3.) HYPOPHOSPHATEMIA. Phosphate 0.6 at admission, 2.1 today.  The most
   likely diagnosis remains respiratory alkalosis from hyperventilation in
   this baseline anxious man. Slightly low likely due to hemodilution in
   the setting of large positive fluid balance. No intervention is
   warranted at this time, but further drop may warrant repletion.
   -Trend phosphate
   4.) History of dizziness and syncope. Given his description, the
   etiology of his dizziness/syncope include orthostatic hypotension,
   vasovagal syncope, cardiogenic syncope, and panic attack. We will rule
   out the most concerning etiology
cardiogenic--but further further
   work-up can be deferred to the outpatient setting if his hypotension is
   well-controlled per the above plan.
   -12 lead EKG and TTE today.
   5.) FEN: Regular diet. No glycemic control required.
   6.) Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin  and pneumoboots.
   7.) Access: peripheral IV
   -Place additional 18G IV
   8.) Code: presumed full
   9.) Communication: Patient
   10.) Disposition: Pending above, with stable BP and no fever spikes
   overnight, he can be called out to the floor tomorrow.

The patient has been on Coumadin for atrial fibrillation and
has had shortness of breath, heart palpitations which had
worsened over the past couple of months.  The patient
underwent echocardiogram and stress test, resulting in the
patient being referred to Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for surgery.
Cardiac catheterization on [**2175-1-17**] showed one vessel
coronary disease OM 30%, right coronary artery 50%, normal
left ventricular function, moderate mitral regurgitation and
ejection fraction of 51%.  Cardiac echocardiogram data from
[**2175-11-17**] showed no aortic insufficiency but had a mitral
valve with rheumatic deformity, ________ commissures, and
tethering of the leaflet motion, mild mitral stenosis and 2+
mitral regurgitation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Included chronic atrial fibrillation,
osteoporosis, rheumatic heart disease and questionable
gastroesophageal reflux disease.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Included mitral valve commissurotomy
in [**2153**], evacuation of left groin clot in [**2161**], left shoulder
rotator cuff surgery and cholecystectomy.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Included Actonel, Toprol XL,
Lasix, spironolactone, hydrochlorothiazide, Coumadin,
Cardizem CD, calcium, Pulmicort Turbuhaler, albuterol and
stool softener.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a former three pack a day
smoker times 20 years but had quit smoking for 25 years.  No
alcohol usage.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Patient was noted to be clear to
auscultation bilaterally with poor air exchange.  No wheezing
or rhonchi noted.  The patient's heart had a regular rate and
a regular rhythm.  Positive S1, S2.  No rales.  Positive [**3-19**]
murmur at the apex radiating to the left axilla.

XR CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2124-12-20**] 6:03 PM
Preliminary Report !! WET READ !!
No acute process.

Brief Hospital Course:
26 y/o F PMH depression who presents following an overdose
Citalopram 20 mg x 30 tablets (600 mg), Quetiapine 100 mg x 11
tablets (1100 mg), Lorazepam 1 mg x 20 tablets (20 mg).
.
# Overdose: Ms [**Known lastname 89742**] presented following an overdose reportedly
of Citalopram 20 mg x 30 tablets (600 mg), Quetiapine 100 mg x
11 tablets (1100 mg), Lorazepam 1 mg x 20  which was 4-5 hours
after arrival to hospital. In the ED her vitals were stable and
ECG showed a mild QTc elevation at 469 for which she was treated
with IV magnesium sulfate. She did not receive charcoal due to
the length of time following her OD. Toxicology consulted and
recommended ICU admission for close monitoring for signs of 1)
Citalopram toxicity including serotonin syndrome, seizures 2)
quetiapine toxicity include lethargy and sedation, miosis,
tachycardia, orthostatic hypotension and other anti-cholinergic
symptoms. Patient displayed no evidence of serotonin syndrome or
anticholinergic toxidrome on physical exam but did exhibit
dilated pupils, horizontal nystagmus and mild myoclonus
initially all of which completely resolved by [**12-21**]. She remained
hemodynamically stable throughout her ICU stay. EKGs were
checked per protocal. There was no evidence of QTC prolongation.
She will need an ECG rechecked in the community. Regarding
mental status, she was initially sedated on arrival to ICU.
Mental status gradually improved and by [**12-21**] she was alert,
fully oriented and cooperative. Given her stable labs, vitals
and ECGs she was deemed medically fit for transfer to psychiatry
for in-patient evaluation and treatment for her depression.
.
# Depression: She has a long standing history of depression and
suicidal ideation, which had acutely worsened in week prior to
overdose. Citalopram, quetiapine, lorazepam and venlafaxine held
in the setting of her overdose. Psychiatry was consulted.
Throughout ICU stay patient displayed active suicidal ideation
and regretted that her attempt had not been successful.
Psychiatry recommended continued 1:1 supervision and suicide
precautions. She was transferred to psychiatry on [**12-22**]
.
# Eating disorder: Past medical history of anorexia nervosa and
per patient this has been an increasing problem recently. [**Name2 (NI) **]
electrolytes were within normal limits. She was monitored on
telemetry without event. Nutrition consulted and calories
counted.
.
# Relative pancytopenia. HIV negative. Iron studies, vitamin B12
and folate within normal limits. Likely secondary to eating
disorder as case reports have documented pancytopenia in this
patient population. CBC will need to be followed as an
outpatient.
.
# Hypothyroid: Her TSH was 9.0 on admission. Her home dose of
levothyroxine was increased to 88mcg. Will need repeat TFTs in
6weeks.

Medications on Admission:
Synthroid 75 mcg qd
Celexa 20 mg qd
Seroquel 100 mg [**12-3**] - 1 tablet qhs
Ativan 1 mg [**12-3**] - 1 tablet qhs.
Medroxyprogesterone 10 mg qd for 10 days to induce menstruation

Discharge Medications:
1. levothyroxine 88 mcg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY
(Daily).


Discharge Disposition:
Extended Care

Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary diagnoses:
Mixed overdose of quetiapine, citalopram and lorazepam
Depression with suicidal ideation
.
Secondary diagnoses:
Hypothyroidism


Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.


Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure taking care of you during your stay at the
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **].

You presented following an overdose of quetiapine, citalopram
and lorazepam in the setting of worsening depression over a
number of days. You arrived too late after the overdose to be
treated with activated charcoal in the ED. You were transferred
to the ICU after being reviewed in the ED by Toxicology. You
were heavily sedated on arrival to the ICU following your
overdose but you were stable with a good blood pressure. You
were closely observed and had several heart tracings (ECGs)
which were unremarkable. You quickly regained consciousness and
by [**2124-12-21**] you were back to your normal mental state. You were
seen by psychiatry and as you still had active suicidal thoughts
we continued 1:1 supervision and you were transferred to an
acute psychiatric in-patient facility for evaluation and
treatment of your depression.

Meedication changes:
We held your psychiatric medications in the setting of your
overdose and these will be restarted by psychiatry
We increased your home levothyroxine to 88mcg per day.

Followup Instructions:
Psychiatry to arrange follow-up
PCP to repeat ECG in the community
Will need repeat CBC and TFTs in 6weeks.

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest burning, mild SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2162-1-8**] Three Vessel Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting utilizing
left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending;
saphenous vein grafts to obtuse marginal and posterior
descending artery.


History of Present Illness:
This is a pleasant 55 year-old man who reported a vague
""burning"" feeling in his chest that began in [**Month (only) 205**] of this year.
He also reports an associated mild SOB. This burning sensation
has occurred with activity such as walking up a steep incline or
even on a flat surface, occasionally depending on what he had
just eaten. Mr. [**Known lastname 6264**] also notes the burning sensation has
occurred at rest, but can be postural - depending on if he is
sitting vs. laying down. The patient often associates most of
these symptoms with his GERD. Finally, the patient also reports
a tightness in the area of his heart that was also tender to
touch. This has occurred with and without activity, with stress
and could last up to one day. On [**2161-12-15**], the patient underwent
an ETT for CP evaluation. The patient for 5.25 minutes of a
modified [**Doctor First Name **] protocol to an APHR of 65% and was stopped for
fatigue. At peak exercise, EKG showed 1-1.5mm of horizontal ST
segment depression in II and lateral leads. These changes turned
to downsloping by 3 minutes post-exercise, and returned to
baseline by 7 minutes of recovery. The rhythm was sinus without
ectopy. Gated images revealed a large, reversible, moderate
intensity perfusion defect involving the PDA territory. Small,
reversible, severe perfusion defect involving the LAD territory.
Transient cavity dilation c/w severe multi-vessel disease.
Moderate LV systolic dysfunction (EF 34%), with apical and
inferior hypokinesis, c/w post-stress running. On [**2161-12-24**],
patient underwent cardiac catheterization which showed severe
three vessel disease and depressed left ventricular function at
35%. Coronary angiography showed a right dominant system with
90% stenosis of the LAD and total occlusions of the second
obtuse marginal and mid right coronary artery. PCI of the RCA
was attempted but unsuccessful. He was therefore referred for
cardiac surgical intervention.

Brief Hospital Course:
On admission, Mr. [**Known lastname 6264**] was brought to the operating room and
underwent three vessel coronary artery bypass grafting by Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **]. The operation was uneventful. Following the
procedure, he was brought to the CSRU for invasive monitoring.
Within 24 hours, he awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated. He maintained stable hemodynamics as he weaned from
inotropic support. His CSRU course was otherwise uncomplicated
and he transferred to the SDU on postoperative day three. He
continued to require diuresis. Over the next several days,
medical therapy was optimized. Beta blockade was resumed with
most of his other preoperative medications. He remained in a
normal sinus rhythm. By discharge, he was near his preoperative
weight with room air oxygen saturations of 97%. His discharge
chest x-ray was notable for only a resolving left pleural
effusion. At time of discharge his blood pressure was 127/69
with a heart rate of 85 in sinus. All surgical wounds were
clean, dry and intact. He will need to remain on supplemental
Iron as an outpatient for his anemia.

   temp wire was placed after a 7 second pause that occurred during
   suctioning. While in the CCU she spontaneously converted from atrial
   fibrillation to sinus rhythm, and had a few fusion beats, but did not

   [**2167-2-12**] the patient is now in sinus rhythm.
   TRANSTHORACIC ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2167-2-13**]:
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
   Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Tissue
   Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
   (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular
   chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
   are moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve
   area 1.2-1.9cm2). The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
   There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is severe mitral annular
   calcification. There is mild functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient
   XXmmHg) due to mitral annular calcification. There is moderate
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
   effusion.
   Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2165-1-7**], the findings are similar.

   ROUNDS:
   74 y/o F with acute on chronic diastolic heart failure, hypertension,
   dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus with recent H. flu pneumonia and
   bacteremia s/p placement of a temporary pacing wire for a 7 second
   pause that occurred during suctioning while the patient was intubated.
   While in the CCU she spontaneously converted from atrial fibrillation
   to sinus rhythm, and had a few fusion beats, but did not have a sinus
   conversion pause.  She remains in sinus rhythm and we do not feel that
   there is any indication for permanent pacing at this time.
   RECS:
   -D/C temporary pacemaker.
   -No indication for permanent pacing.
   This patient was seen, discussed and evaluated with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  MRI of the brain.

 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Patient for evaluation of cerebellar metastasis.

 TECHNIQUE:  T1 sagittal and axial and FLAIR, T2 susceptibility and diffusion
 axial images of the brain obtained before gadolinium.  T1 sagittal, axial, and
 coronal images obtained following the administration of gadolinium. Comparison
 was made with the previous CT examination of [**2118-10-20**].

 FINDINGS:  As seen on the CT, there are two well-defined discrete rim-
 enhancing masses identified in the cerebellum, one in each cerebellar
 hemisphere.  The mass in the right cerebellar hemisphere measures
 approximately 28 mm in size and the one in the left cerebellar hemisphere
 measures 24 mm in size.  There is surrounding edema with mass effect on the
 adjacent fourth ventricle.  There is moderate ventriculomegaly with mild
 periventricular edema indicative of obstructive hydrocephalus.  There are no
 foci of abnormal enhancement seen in the supratentorial region.  Diffusion
 images demonstrate no evidence of slow diffusion.

 IMPRESSION:  Rim-enhancing lesion in both cerebellar hemispheres consistent
 with metastatic disease.  Moderate obstructive hydrocephalus.  Edema involving
 the cerebellar hemispheres with slightly low position of the cerebellar
 tonsils.

SKIN: No jaundice, cyanosis, or gross dermatitis. No ecchymoses.



Pertinent Results:
CXR [**2111-8-24**]: An esophageal stent extends from the level of the
carina to the upper stomach, pinched to about half its general
diameter at the level of the left atrium.  Mediastinum is
shifted to the left. Dense left perihilar consolidation could be
pneumonia, could also be radiation change, and mass. Heart is
moderately  enlarged whether due to cardiomegaly or pericardial
effusion is indeterminate.
Large irregular opacity obscuring the apex of the aortic knob
could be a
pleural or lung mass or just atelectasis. Small to moderate left
pleural
effusion is present. Any prior imaging of the chest should be
obtained for comparison purposes to determine the nature and
significance of the multiple findings described above.
.
CXR [**2111-8-25**]: Progression of the left lung consolidation with a
new left-sided pleural effusion. The appearences are again very
likely secondary to aspiration.
.
CXR [**2111-8-26**]: Interval worsening of left upper and left lower
lobe consolidation that might represent a combination of
aspiration and atelectasis. The heart size is unchanged. There
is no pneumothorax.
.
CXR [**2111-8-28**]: There is improvement in the left upper lobe
consolidation, with persistent left lower lobe consolidation and
a new left sided pleural effusion with left lower lobe and
lingular atelectasis. Mediastinal silhouette and esophageal
stent are unchanged.
.
CXR [**2111-8-28**]: No short interval change in appearance of the left
lung, with
findings likely representing a combination of consolidation and
atelectasis combined with a moderate left pleural effusion.
Considering presence of volume loss, CT may be considered to
exclude an obstructing process if warranted clinically. Cardiac
silhouette remains enlarged and mediastinum remains widened.
Esophageal stent is unchanged in appearance. Increasing
interstitial opacities in right lung likely reflect asymmetric
edema from fluid overload, and there is persistent right basilar
atelectasis and adjacent small effusion, unchanged.
.
CTA [**2111-8-28**]: 1. No pulmonary embolism.
2. Large bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right,
with associated atelectasis. Given cardiomegaly, these findings
may represent congestive heart failure.
3. Small amount of secretions within the right lower lobe
bronchus and
layering of material within the lower esophageal wall stent.
Aspiration is a diagnostic possiblity.
4. Enlarged pulmonary artery suggestive of pulmonary
hypertension.
5. Probably patent lower esophageal stent. However, please note,
stent patency or stenosis cannot be directly assessed on this
evaluation and a barium esophagram could be performed for
further assessment as clinically indicated.
.
ECG [**2111-8-25**]: Sinus rhythm with a single ventricular premature
beat. Low limb lead voltage. No previous tracing available for
comparison.
.
ECG [**2111-8-25**]: Sinus rhythm. Baseline artifact. Poor R wave
progression. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2111-8-25**] the
ventricular premature beat is absent and artifact is new.
.
CXR [**2111-9-1**]:
Large multiloculated left pleural effusion has changed in
distribution but not in overall severity. Left lower lobe is
still collapsed. Left upper lobe atelectasis has improved. Small
right pleural effusion is stable or slightly  increased.
Pulmonary vascular congestion persists, but I see no pulmonary
edema. Cardiac silhouette is obscured by adjacent pleural
abnormality but is probably large though unchanged. No
pneumothorax. Lower esophageal stent unchanged in position.
.
[**2111-9-2**] VIDEO SWALLOW:
IMPRESSION: Minimal penetration with thin consistency barium.
Otherwise,
normal oropharyngeal swallowing evaluation. Please refer to the
full notes by speech and swallow pathologist from the same date,
detailed in the treatment recommendations.
.
[**2111-9-3**] CT HEAD:
INDINGS: There are diffuse hypodense areas in the bilateral
frontal lobes
and periventricular regions likely representing small vessel
ischemic disease. There are no masses. There are no areas that
enhance inappropriately with contrast. There is no disturbance
of the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white delineation. There is no evidence of
hemorrhage or mass effect. The ventricles and sulci are mildly
prominent in nature, but appropriate for the patient's age. No
bony lesions are noted.
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence for metastatic disease.
2. Mild small vessel ischemic disease.

Brief Hospital Course:
86 F with history of esophageal and squamous cell lung cancer,
admitted for paliative esophageal stent placement complicated by
aspiration pneumonia.

# shortness of breath - initially attributed to an aspiration
pneumonia, this occured in the setting of esophageal stent
placement. She was started on treatment with levofloxacin and
flagyl on [**8-26**] and completed a 8 9 day course.  Given this
aspiration occured she was evaluated by speech and swallow and
recommended thin liquids and regular diet.  She continued to
have shortness of breath over the course of [**8-7**].  CTA
revealed a large left pleural effusion.  She received IVF fluids
on [**8-31**] for orthostasis and again on [**9-1**] for frank hypotension
felt [**3-9**] dehydration.  In this setting, concern was raised for
volume overload.  She was treated by optimizing rate control,
and gentle IV lasix on [**9-3**].  Her dyspnea was not markedly
changed with lasix, and her atrial fibrillation and hyponatremia
worsened.
.
Given poor response to lasix, and ongoing tachypnea (with
negative CTA), discussion was held over the possibility of
therapeutic thoracentesis.  The effusion is new as it was not
present on prior CXR on [**2111-8-14**] with her oncologist.  After
discussion with her oncologist ([**Last Name (un) 82949**] Anamur, [**Telephone/Fax (1) 82950**]),
this effusion was felt to be malignant (her lung ca is located
in the LUL and had improved s/p XRT), and felt likely to
reaccumulate.  Her prognosis was felt to be poor given 2 primary
malignancies, and her inability to tolerate chemotherapy.
.
After extensive discussion with the patient, her daughter [**Name (NI) **]
(HCP), the patient declined thoracentesis, and elected to change
goals of care to comfort measures only.  She was treated with
oral ativan and morphine for respiratory comfort.  She will be
discharged to hospice.  She may receive lasix prn dyspnea,
however these efforts have been limited by tachycardia and
hypotension during this hospitalization.
.
On the day of discharge, the above plan was again communicated
to the patient, and her son-in-law [**Name (NI) **] (alternate HCP) as her
daughter [**Name (NI) **] was not available.
.
# dizziness - pt complained of dizziness after starting
antibiotics.  her neurologic exam was non-focal.  head CT was
unremarkable for metastasis.  she demonstrated no nystagmus or
evidence of BPPV.  her dizziness was attributed to orthostasis
and medication.  her neurontin, percoceet and flagyl were
discontinued with mild improvement in her symptoms.  she is
being discharged to hospice with prn meclezine.
.
# diarrhea - likely [**3-9**] antibiotics, and improving at the time
of discharge.  she had stool cultures x3 negative for cdiff, and
general stool culture negative on [**9-2**].  she will be discharged
with prn lomotil.
.
#. Atrial fibrilation: Pt is rate controlled on dilt and amio at
home, though she is not anticoagulated.  She had intermittent
episodes of breakthrough RVR in 120-130s in the icu thought
likely due to underlying aspiration PNA and hypoxia.  She
remained asymptomatic with the RVR, diltiazem regimen was
titrated up and metoprolol was added to acheive better rate
control.  Her heart rate ranges between 80-120 on this regimen
and BP remains stable.  She did develop pleural effusions in
this setting requiring intermittent diuresis, as above.
.
She is being discharged to hospice on her regimen of metoprolol,
diltiazem, and amiodarone for comfort, as she becomes anxious
when she senses a rapid heart rate.
.
#. Esophageal + Lung Ca: pt with 2 primary malignancies,
including T3N1 esophageal  adenocarcinoma, with squamous cell
lung cancer s/p XRT, both diagnosed in [**2110**].  She is not a
chemotherapy candidate per discussion with her oncology provider
(above).  She received a palliative esophageal stent placement.
.
As above, she is being discharged to hospice given large left
pleural effusion and ongoing dyspnea

#. Depression: She is continued on home citalopram.

#. Post herpetic neuralgia: She had herpes zoster 7 weeks prior
with residual pain. She had sedation/somnolence on neurontin so
this was held, and liquid percocet was attempted.  Given ongoing
dizziness, neurontin and percocet were discontinued with some
improvement.  Her pain was controlled with tylenol.  She will be
discharged to hospice with morphine as above.
.
#. Hypertension: Previously hypertensive, for which she was
continued on diltiazem, up titrated as above with metoprolol for
rate control.  She subsequently was treated with IVF for
hypotension felt likely [**3-9**] dehydration and poor po intake.

#. COPD: She only uses albuterol at home.
#. GERD: continue PPI for comfort.
#. Hyperlipidemia: simvastatin was discontinued.
.
# CODE STATUS - pt made DNR/DNI after extensive discussion with
family and patient. she is being discharged to hospice with
comfort measures only, and understands no further role for
hospitalization as she is not interested in thoracentesis or
further surgical procedures to treat her malignancy, and is not
a chemotherapy candidate.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Former smoker.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 97.6, blood
pressure 102/64, heart rate 86, respiratory rate 16, oxygen
saturation 100% on room air.  The patient appeared to be a
rather thin woman in no apparent distress.  Head, eyes, ears,
nose and throat examination within normal limits.
Cardiovascular examination regular rate and rhythm, II/VI
systolic ejection murmur, soft heart sounds.  Chest:  Good
inspiratory effort, clear to auscultation bilaterally,
occasional crackles bibasilarly.  Abdominal examination:
Bowel sounds present, abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended.
Extremities:  Bilateral pitting edema, extremities otherwise
warm and well perfused, no pulses palpable secondary to
edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  Hematocrit 29.9, white blood cell count
9.2.  PT 13.9, PTT 150.  Glucose 90, BUN 56, creatinine 1.8,
potassium 4.4.  An electrocardiogram obtained on [**2165-9-10**]
showed a probable accelerated junctional rhythm.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was originally admitted to the
Medicine service.  She was placed on intravenous heparin.
She was continued on amiodarone.  The patient was also
started on amoxicillin for endocarditis prophylaxis.  The
patient was transfused with two units of packed red blood
cells.  The patient was diuresed.  At the time, Cardiac
Surgery was consulted about a possible surgical intervention,
given valvular disease.

On [**2165-9-12**], the patient underwent tricuspid valve repair (#32
[**Doctor Last Name **] annuloplasty ring) and mitral valve repair (#29 St.
[**Male First Name (un) 1525**] mechanical valve).  The procedure was without any
complications.  Please see the full operative note for
details.

The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit in
stable condition.  The patient continued to be in accelerated
junctional rhythm.  No ectopy was noted.  Electrophysiology
service was consulted.  Their opinion was that both the A and
the V leads were malfunctioning.  The patient was extubated
on postoperative day one.  The patient tolerated extubation
well.  Physical Therapy was consulted to follow the patient
throughout the hospitalization.  The chest tubes and the
urine catheter were removed.  The patient was continued on
intravenous heparin and she was also given a dose of Coumadin
on postoperative day three.

Electrophysiology service was following the patient
throughout the hospitalization.  The patient's pacemaker was
re-interrogated on postoperative day four.  Their opinion was
that the pacing leads are not functioning well, but overall
system is adequate with VVI pacing.  They thought that lead
revision would very likely be a long procedure without
guarantee of improving quality of right atrial or right
ventricular leads.  Given the fact that the patient is not
pacemaker dependent, the decision was made to not proceed
with lead revision but to follow the patient clinically.

The patient was also seen in-house by the congestive heart
failure attending, who recommended changes to the diuresis
regimen.  The patient continued to do well.  She continued to
be in junctional rhythm with some ectopy.  On [**2165-9-18**], the
patient had one run of ventricular tachycardia (four beats),
which was not repeated.  In addition, the patient's potassium
level was measured at 2.1.  It was adequately replenished
with oral and intravenous potassium at the time.  The
patient's repeat potassium was stable at 4.2.

The patient was discharged to a rehabilitation facility on
[**2165-9-19**] in stable condition.

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: The left atrium is elongated.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: The right atrium is mildly dilated. The
inferior vena cava is dilated (>2.5 cm), with minimal respiratory variation
consistent with a right atrial pressure >20 mmHg.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is unusually small. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is no resting left ventricular outflow
tract obstruction. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There
is no ventricular septal defect.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right
ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular systolic function appears
depressed. There is abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent with
right ventricular pressure overload.

AORTA: The aortic root is normal in diameter. There are focal calcifications
in the aortic root. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are focal
calcifications in the ascending aorta. The aortic arch is normal in diameter.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.

AORTIC VALVE: The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but not
stenotic.

MITRAL VALVE: The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. The mitral valve supporting structures are normal.
There is no significant mitral stenosis. Mild to moderate ([**1-22**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired
relaxation.

TRICUSPID VALVE: The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The
tricuspid valve supporting structures are normal. There is no triscupid
stenosis. Mild tricuspid [1+] regurgitation is seen.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: The pulmonic valve leaflets are thickened.
There is severe pulmonic valve stenosis.

PERICARDIUM: There is a small pericardial effusion.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
The left ventricular cavity is unusually small. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular
free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right
ventricular systolic function appears depressed. There is abnormal systolic
septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure overload.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are focal calcifications in the
aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but not
stenotic. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**1-22**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonic valve leaflets are thickened.
There is severe pulmonic valve stenosis; the proximal main pulmonary artery
appears compressed, and the pulmonic stenosis appears supravalvular. There is
a small pericardial effusion.

Impression: possible extrinsic compression of the main pulmonary artery;
severe supravalvular pulmonic stenosis; MR imaging or CT scanning recommended
to delineate the cause of pulmonic stenosis.

 EXAMINATION PERFORMED:  AP Chest.

 INDICATION FOR STUDY:  Lower lobe pneumonia.

 This study is performed as a followup from a recent chest x-ray of [**6-5**]
 which showed bilateral patchy airspace disease.  On the current examination, a
 single AP chest image is obtained on [**2176-6-14**] at 1559 hours.  The heart is not
 enlarged.  There is patchy linear increase in density in the right base
 consistent with minimal subsegmental atelectasis or airspace disease.  The
 remainder of the lung fields shows a significant improvement since the prior
 study.  There is a left-sided PICC line with its tip in the expected location
 of the brachiocephalic vein.  There is evidence of prior cardiac surgery.

 IMPRESSION:

 Marked improvement in the appearance of the chest since the prior examination.
 Residual linear density in the right base may represent subsegmental
 atelectasis, airspace disease, or fibrosis.

   Assessment and Plan
   75yoM CAD, CHF, PVD, s/p resp failure with trach/PEG with vent assoc
   ESBL Klebsiella and Acineotbacter pna on [**Last Name (un) **]/Cefepime, VRE
   bacteremia/sepsis on daptomycin, and LUE/RLE DVT on enox. Requires
   nightly vent assistance for anxiety/tachypnea/diaphoresis.
   > Respiratory failure - Pna (ESBL klebsiella and acinetobacter),
   worsening b/l pleural effusions that have reaccumlated following
   thoracentesis, and significant of abdominal distention.   Not treating
   MDR acinetobacter or stenotrophomonas. Effusion was tapped for 1.2 L on
   [**11-13**] and was transudative. He is also complicated by profound volume
   overload and weakness (exacerbated by over all deconditioning,
   prolonged MICU stay and courses of steroids).  Of note, patient has
   been having very bloody secretions since [**11-14**]
 bronch deferred given
   stable from a respiratory standpoint and likely scope/suctioning trauma
   given anticoagulation.  Now requiring ventilator support, likely due to
   increased volume, capillary leak from low level sepsis and possible
   aspiration given cuff leak.  A new PNA as source of VRE is possible as
   well.
   -          Trach collar mask and intermittent vent support as needed.
   -          CXR
   -          Completed 14 day course of Cefepime/[**Last Name (un) **] today
   -          Diuresis as tolerated
    > Bacteremia/Sepsis: VRE growing out of blood from [**11-15**] that may
   explain fever/hypotension from [**11-14**].  Now afebrile for a few days with
   stable CXR. Will need to f/u sputum, blood and urine clx and add
   daptomycin for now.  Unclear source as PICC line is new on 25^th and no
   evidence of UTI. [**Month (only) 60**] be from new PNA given progression of CXR over past
   few days.  His skin exam is actually improved since [**10-27**]. The
   thoracentesis on [**11-13**] has been unrevealing in terms of empyema as it
   appears to be most consistent with a transudative effusion with benign
   pH. ID does not feel that patient needs coverage for MDR
   acinetobacter/stenotrophomonas ([**11-12**]) at this time.  Have completed 14
   day course of cefepime/[**Last Name (un) 430**] for VAP based on [**11-3**] cultures.
   -          F/U blood (picc vs peripheral), urine, sputum and c.diff
   -          Continue dapto for VRE
   -          Decrease hydrocortisone 25mg IV
   -          ID said to add colistin if worsens
   > Oliguria/ARF: Likely prerenal, but in the setting of massive
   anasarca.  Now making decent urine.
   -          Check bladder pressure
   -          Gently diurese
   >Hypernatremia: Now slightly worse.
   - Increase FWF.
   >  Ileus.  Patient had ileus since [**10-30**] that has now resolved with NGT
   suctioning, bowel rest, and minimizing opioids.  Tolerating tube feeds
   at goal with reglan for promotility
   -          bowel regimen
   -          ultram only at low dose with turns, caution with opioids,
   cont reglan
    >  Anemia:  H/o UGIB/coffee grounds.  Noted to have coffee grounds in
   NG suctioning on [**11-3**], likely secondary to prolonged NG suctioning.
   Now with decreased hct of unclear source, but having hemoptysis. S/p 1
   unit PRBC with downtrending Hct with another unit today.   Possible
   that he is just oozing from various sources given anticoagulation.
   -          Serial Hcts
   -          Po ppi
   -          hold aspirin, plavix; consider resuming aspirin in future if
   hct/ bleed remains stable
   -          Transfuse for Hct goal >25
   -
   > LUE/RLE DVT.  Anticoagulation with heparin started on [**11-8**].
   Transitioned to lovenox on [**11-9**].
   -          continue lovenox at low dose, 60mg [**Hospital1 **], based on dry weight
   (concern for bleeding)
   -          [**Month (only) 60**] need to hold if Hct drops significantly
   > A. fib.  Has A. fib with RVR.  HR currently in 100s.  Getting
   anticoagulated.
   -          titrating BB
   -          on Lovenox
   >  PVD - awaiting revascularization after DC.  Stable LLE dry gangrene.
   -          further management per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as patient recovers from
   this hospitalization.
   -          hold asa/plavix given above, consider resuming aspirin when
   NGT is removed and hct stable
   -          hold opioids due to ileus
   > HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC
 hold on diuresis given hypotension,

 COMPARISON:  AP chest from earlier the same day.

 AP CHEST:  There is a right-sided PA catheter which extends into the main
 pulmonary artery.  The newly placed NG tube is coiled in the mid-esophagus,
 possibly within a hiatal hernia.  The endotracheal tube lies 4.5 cm from the
 carina.  Sternotomy wires and skin staples overlie the midline.  There is
 unchanged diffuse, mainly left-sided subcutaneous emphysema.  Patchy opacities
 are seen within both lungs, most prominently in the left upper lobe.  These
 findings are consistent with persistent asymmetric pulmonary edema.  Two chest
 tubes overlie the left hemithorax.  There is no pneumothorax.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  NG tube coiled within mid-esophagus.
 2.  Persistent patchy opacities within both lungs, consistent with persistent
 asymmetric pulmonary edema.

   Requesting physician: [**Name10 (NameIs) 4235**]
   Initial consultation: CCU
   Presenting complaint: Arrhythmia, Syncope
   History of present illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 7194**] is an 80yo female with a
   history of HTN on atenolol and diltiazem long standing who presents
   with syncope.  She states that she was in her USOH until yesterday.
   All day was relatively tired, did a lot of activity the day prior.  Had
   dinner without problems, but then had some shoulder pain and nausea.
   Got out of bed to go to urinate, but in bathroom, more lightheaded and
   had unwitnessed syncope.  No injuries.  She was found by husband
   slumping near a wall and was brought to couch.  Pt reports felt very
   ""washed out"" for hours afterwards with some nausea. In ER, noted to
   have junctional rhythm in the 30-40's with SBP 80's which was treated
   with atropine and dobutamine which increased sinus rate to 50's.  This
   AM, she feels well, still with a little bit of fatigue, no nausea.
   When attempting to wean off dobutamine, pt had sinus brady again with
   [**1-27**] second pauses.
   Only ever pre-syncopal episode she has ever had was at the time of her
   CVA several years ago.  There have been no recent changes in her meds.
   The atenolol and dilt have been the same dose for years.

   axis/LAHB, no path Q, no signif ST-T changes
   Several ECGs on [**6-12**] with sinus bradycardia with junctional escape in
   the 30-40bpm
   Assessment and Plan
   80yo female on significant doses of nodal agents who presents with
   syncope and found to have a junctional rhythm with sinus bradycardia
   requiring dobutamine infusion to maintain HR.  She likely has
   underlying sinus node dysfunction which is exacerbated by the nodal
   agents.  This particular syncopal event may possibly be related to a
   transient vagal episode given the nausea, hypotension, and ""washed out
   feeling"" in the settin go pain and having to urinate.  However, she
   still has significant sinus brady requiring catecholamines.
   - check TSH
   - continue to hold atenolol and diltiazem and observe
   - try to stop dobutamine again to check underlying sinus rate,  if
   still very brady (30
s) requiring DBA all weekend then fairly clear
   indication of significant sinus node dysfunction which will require
   PPM.  Any vagal event and nodal agents should be over by tomorrow.
   However, if sinus rate improves, then would have her ambulate to see if
   sinus rate appropriately increases, if not, then still has a clear
   indication for PPM for SSS.
   - keep NPO after midnight on Sun for possible PPM on Mon.

CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  ([**2179-3-25**])
IMPRESSION: Large ""saddle"" embolus within the main pulmonary
artery with extension into both main pulmonary arteries and
their subsegmental branches. There is associated ground-glass
opacity in the left upper lobe that most likely represents an
acute infarction. There is also CT evidence of right ventricular
strain as demonstrated by right ventricular dilatation. The main
pulmonary artery size is in the upper limit of normal range.

ECHO ([**2179-3-26**])
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded.  Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests a normal left ventricularn filling pressure
(PCWP<12mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated.
There is severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly  thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2179-3-28**]
A previously reported confluent left perihilar opacity shows
slight interval improvement with residual hazy opacity
remaining. Remainder of the lungs are clear, and there are no
pleural effusions.

Brief Hospital Course:
1.  Pulmonary embolism:
Patient presented with a large saddle PE involving the main
pulmonary artery extending into both pulmonary arteries and
their subsegmental branches.  An echo was performed which showed
evidence of right heart strain.  An IVC filter was placed on
[**2179-3-26**].  She was started on a heparin gtt with coumadin.  The
patient's INR was followed and the heparing gtt was stopped when
an INR was elevated at 6.6.  She should continue on warfarin for
at least 6months.  INR was 3.2 on the day of discharge.
Warfarin should be held [**4-2**] and resumed [**2179-4-3**] at 2mg QHS.

She initially required high-flow mask to maintain O2 sats; this
was weaned over her stay - she was mid 90s on 5 liters via nasal
cannula at the time of discharge.  Blood pressures were stable
throughout with a persistent tachycardia present.
It was felt that the PE was secondary to immobilization from her
many prior surgeries.

2. Pneumonia:
Fevers, leukocytosis on admission. CXR/CT were consistent with
pneumonia.  She was treated with levofloxacin for seven days.

3. Hypertension:
Initially, her atenolol and valsartan were held in the setting
of acute PE.  The beta-blocker was restarted slowly (as
metoprolol [**Hospital1 **]) as the patient remained tachycardic (possibly
from rebound).  She was discharged on atenolol 25mg daily.  The
valsartan was held throughout with the possibility of restarting
upon discharge.

4. Hypercholesterolemia:
Continued statin.

5. Hypothyroidism:
Continued synthroid.

6. Osteooarthritis:
Continued fosamax, calcium, celebrex, oxycodone PRN.

7. Peripheral edema:
Patient presented on Lasix/Spironolactone for chronic lower
extremity edema.  In the setting of possible RV dysfunction from
PE, these medications were held.  Stockings were used to help
mobilize some of the fluid.

Medications on Admission:
1. Alendronate 70 mg qweek
2. Amitriptyline 100 mg daily
3. Aspirin 325 mg daily

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted and fount to have a large pulmonary embolism.
Please be sure to continue taking all you medications as
prescribed.  It will be particuarularly important that you take
coumadin for at least six month (possibly longer); while taking
this, you will need to have blood work drawn to monitor your
coumadin level (INR).

Continue to take coumadin every day. Your levels need to be
monitored regularly for a goal INR of [**12-26**].

Work with your primary care physician to keep up with you pap
smear, mammogram, and colonoscopy since sometimes blood clots
can be related to cancer.  You should also discuss having a
""hypercoagulable work-up"" with your doctor.  This may be
indicated after you complete the course of warfarin as you have
had repeated blood clots.

Followup Instructions:
You have the following appointment scheduled:

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON [**10-17**] AT 9:35 P.M.

 INDICATION:  Severe COPD exacerbation.  Possible mass seen on AP film.

 FINDINGS:  Compared with the AP portable study earlier the same day, as well
 as to prior studies from [**2203-7-29**], as well as to a more remote study of
 [**2203-2-21**], the roughly 4 cm rounded density seen on the film earlier today
 overlying the right mid lung field is no longer identified. This is felt to
 represent an old pleural focus of thickening/fibrosis rather than a mass
 lesion or pneumonia.  Its appearance on the earlier film  was due to
 significant rightward rotation of the patient.  The current study is not
 rotated, and the bilateral multifocal rib fractures and adjacent pleural
 thickening and healing callus formation are chronic/subacute findings.

 The heart and mediastinum are unremarkable.  The lungs appear grossly clear of
 active infiltrates.  There has been further interval loss of height of the
 compression fracture deformities in the mid thoracic spine since [**2203-1-26**],
 with accentuation of the thoracic kyphosis.  Lungs are hyperinflated
 consistent with the known history of COPD.

 IMPRESSION:  Density seen on the study earlier today, overlying the right mid
 lung field is consistent with old right lateral focal pleural
 thickening/fibrosis, which is stable.  There are chronic changes as above.  No
 obvious acute process.

  Mild to moderate pulmonary edema and central pulmonary vascular congestion.
  Small bilateral pleural effusions.  Mild ascites. Diverticulosis. No arterial
  aneurysms. Prosthetic mitral valve. Moderate to severe atherosclerotic
  calcifications throghout the aorta and major branches, resulting in moderate
  stenosis of the celicac takeoff (401b:38). No flow seen within the proximal

  iliac arteries, which are patent. No dissection or large pulmonary embolus.
 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Mitral valve stenosis.  Assess for aortic, femoral, iliac
 vascular calcification.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT-acquired axial images were obtained from the thoracic inlet
 to the pubic symphysis after the administration of intravenous contrast in a
 split bolus with excretory and arterial phase imaging.  Coronal and sagittal
 reformations were prepared.  Additionally, 3D volume-rendered images, and
 curved reformats were prepared at a separate workstation.

 COMPARISON:  CT of the chest without contrast [**2171-2-14**].

 CT OF THE CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  Thyroid is heterogeneous and enlarged with
 likely multiple nodules.  There is no supraclavicular, axillary, or hilar
 lymphadenopathy, though scattered non-enlarged nodes are seen.  Within the
 mediastinum, multiple scattered nodes are seen, though none appear enlarged.
 A 1-cm prevascular lymph node is seen anterior to the superior vena cava
 (3:49), which is minimally increased from the prior study.  Non-enlarged
 prevascular nodes are seen.  A precarinal 1.1-cm node is not significantly
 changed since the prior study (3:39).  Two subcarinal nodes, one measuring 1.2
 and one measuring 1.3 cm are seen (3:50), again not significantly changed from
 the prior study.  Within the lungs, mosaic attenuation suggests small airways
 disease with possible superimposed mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema given
 right greater than left simple-appearing pleural effusions and cardiomegaly.
 Passive atelectasis also seen.  Within the right upper lobe, there is a 4-mm
 nodule (3:49), which is not significantly changed from the prior study.
 Pleuroparenchymal scarring is seen with focal areas of pleural thickening in
 the lingula (3:47).

 Significant cardiomegaly is seen with right greater than left atrial
 enlargement.  The patient is status post coronary bypass graft with median

 sternotomy wires noted and appearing intact.  There is no pericardial
 effusion.  The patient is status post mitral valve prosthesis, which is not
 well evaluated on this study.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  The liver is unremarkable without focal
 lesion, intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.  Gallbladder is
 unremarkable.  The pancreas, spleen and right adrenal gland are unremarkable.
 Within the left adrenal gland, there is some focal nodularity without discrete
 measurable nodule (3:116).  The kidneys enhance and excrete contrast
 symmetrically without hydronephrosis.  The stomach, small and large bowel are
 unremarkable with the exception of diverticular disease without active
 inflammation.  Mild ascites is seen predominantly perihepatic, perisplenic,
 and dependently located within the pelvis, which is simple in appearance.
 There are no pathologic mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph nodes, though
 scattered non-enlarged nodes are seen.  No free air in the abdomen.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  The bladder, uterus, and rectum are
 unremarkable.   Dependent free fluid is seen in the pelvis.  There is no
 pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.

 CTA:  Extensive atherosclerotic calcification is seen of the abdominal aorta
 and bilateral common, external and internal iliac arteries, continuing into
 the common femoral arteries.  These vessels appear patent without major
 flow-limiting stenosis.  Calcification is also seen at the ostia of the renal
 arteries, superior mesenteric artery, and celiac artery with stenosis of the
 origin of celiac artery and to a lesser degree the SMA.  The [**Female First Name (un) 85**] does not
 demonstrate antegrade flow but appears to reconstitute distally.  Normal
 conventional hepatic arterial anatomy seen.

 OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  Multilevel degenerative changes are seen with vacuum disc
 noted throughout the lumbar spine.  Rounded calcific densities seen projecting
 over the right half of the spinal canal at T9, not changed from prior study
 (3:75) is likely a large osteophyte.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Small airways disease with likely superimposed mild-to-moderate pulmonary
 edema with small right greater than left pleural effusions and cardiomegaly.
 2.  Mild ascites.
 3.  Vascular calcifications of the thoracic and abdominal aorta along with
 common, external, internal iliac arteries and common femoral arteries, without
 evidence of stenosis.  Moderate stenosis of the celiac artery at its origin.
 4.  Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
 5.  Unchanged 4-mm pulmonary nodule. No follow up is required if the patient
 is low risk for malignancy. If high risk, follow up in 12 months is suggested.

 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dating back to [**2158-6-21**].

 The patient was extubated with removal of the NG tube.  The left subclavian
 line tip is at the level of low SVC/cavoatrial junction.  The hardware appears
 to be unchanged.  There is slight interval improvement in the left upper lobe
 consolidation, although it may be related to differences in the study
 technique.  On the other hand, there is worsening of the left basal opacity
 that might be consistent with atelectasis/aspiration with similar but less
 extensive process at the right base.  The lung volumes are lower which might
 be due to termination of mechanical ventilation.

 Overall, the appearance of the lung is better than on [**2158-6-22**] radiograph.

 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY, [**2137-3-19**]

 No prior studies for comparison.

 FINDINGS:  Intra-aortic balloon pump is present with tip terminating 4.8 cm
 below the superior aspect of the aortic knob.  Heart size is normal but
 demonstrates slight left ventricular configuration, and the aorta is mildly
 tortuous.  Lungs are grossly clear except for minimal linear scar versus
 atelectasis at right lung base.  No pleural effusions are evident on this
 single projection.  There is a suggestion of calcified pleural plaques, which
 could be confirmed with standard PA and lateral views when the patient's
 condition permits.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  Intra-aortic balloon pump terminates 4.8 cm below the superior aspect of
 the aortic knob.

 2.  Probable calcified pleural plaques, a finding associated with asbestos
 exposure.  Confirmation with standard PA and lateral chest radiograph is
 recommended prior to discharge once the patient's clinical condition permits.

  EVAL FOR EXTENT OF CALCANEAL OM
 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate extent of osteomyelitis involving the left calcaneus.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar MR of the left foot was performed with proton density
 and T2-weighted imaging, with additional sagittal, coronal, and axial STIR
 images of the foot, as well as axial images of the foot with T1-weighted
 imaging pre and post-gadolinium.

 Correlation is made to the CT of the foot performed 2 days previously.

 FINDINGS:

 STIR images of the foot demonstrate a diffusely elevated signal involving
 virtually the entire calcaneus, with a more normal appearance of signal in the
 immediately subchondral regions adjacent to the cuboid and talus.  Of note,
 there is a well-circumscribed area of increased STIR signal in the central
 calcaneus, which corresponds to the region of a paucity of trabeculae as
 discussed with the podiatry service regarding the prior CT examination.
 However, when correlating these images to the pre and post-contrast T1-
 weighted images of the foot, there is no corresponding region of enhancement.
 This region demonstrates slightly elevated signal on T1-weighted images as
 well as proton density-weighted images, but did not show significant elevation
 of signal on the T2- weighted images.

 There is enhancement within the calcaneus, immediately adjacent to the region
 of bony destruction seen on the prior CT, corresponding to osteomyelitis as
 previously reported. While no enhancement in the mid portion of the calcaneus
 (at the region of concern described above) is present to define an abscess or
 focally infected collection, given the increased signal on the STR images
 throughout the calcaneus, spread of infection beyond the area of enhancement
 and to the remainder of the calcaneus cannot be excluded.

 In addition to the area of bony involvement deep to the ulcer, there is
 diffuse soft tissue edema along the plantar aspect of the heel, consistent
 within the known infection/inflammation.  There is also increased edema within
 the flexor digitorum longus and flexor hallucis longus muscles. Slightly
 increased signal in the Achilles tendon is also present.

 None of the other bones within the foot demonstrate signals suggestive of
 edema. Two small areas of focal edema are seen within the distal fibula
 (series 17, image 207), which are nonspecific.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  In the region of sparse trabeculae within the mid calcaneus, at the area
 of concern discussed with the podiatry service, there is focal edematous
 change of fat, but without discrete enhancing collection to suggest abscess.
 2.  However, given the diffuse edema throughout the entire calcaneus, we
 cannot exclude the spread of osteomyelitis beyond the area of bony destruction
 at the posterior/inferior aspect of the calcaneus deep to the ulcer by mri.
 3.  There is edema of the plantar foot, including edema along the flexor
 hallucis longus and flexor digitorum longus muscles.
 4. Small focus of edema in distal fibula of uncertain significance.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS:

 CLINICAL HISTORY:  61-year-old man with new onset of pain after liver
 transplant.  Patient with new onset of severe left flank pain that radiates to
 the left side of the abdomen.  Please assess for possible cause.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT-acquired axial images were obtained through the abdomen and
 pelvis initially without contrast followed by contrast-enhanced images through
 the abdomen and pelvis after administration of 130 cc of Optiray.

 Oral contrast was not administered.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images
 were also obtained.

 Comparison is made to the prior study dated [**2180-10-10**].  Limited images through
 the lung bases are unremarkable.

 Note is made of mitral annulus calcifications.

 There has been interval placement of a portal vein stent.  There are new coils
 in the varices in the region of the GE junction.  There also appears to have
 been an interval decrease in the size and number of previously noted
 esophageal and gastric varices.  Note is made of a focal hypodense, eccentric
 thrombus in one of the gastric varices rostral to the coils.

 There is no ascites.

 The liver parenchyma is unremarkable with exception of a peripheral wedge-
 shaped enhancing area in the lateral aspect of the right hepatic lobe (segment
 VII).  Evaluation of the vessels in this region reveals lack of enhancement of
 one of the distal branches of the right portal vein suggestive of thrombosis.

 The remaining visualized branches of the portal veins, superior mesenteric
 vein, and splenic vein are patent. The spleen is enlarged but it appears to
 have decreased in size since the prior study, now measuring 15 cm (previously
 17.1 cm) on coronal images.

 The native kidneys are atrophic, but there is no hydronephrosis.  There is a
 non-obstructing calculus in the left kidney that measures approximately 4 mm.
 There is an exophytic simple 2.6 cm left renal cyst.

 Numerous small paraaortic retroperitoneal lymph nodes are noted that measure
 less than 1 cm in short axis and do not meet CT criteria for malignancy.

 BONE WINDOWS:

 No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are identified.  There are
 degenerative changes in the lumbar spine.  Multiple vertebral body compression
 deformities are noted, most prominent at L1 vertebral level.  This does not
 appear significantly changed.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  Interval coiling of gastric varices and portal vein stent placement.
 Interval improvement in the size and number of previously noted intraabdominal
 varices as well as periportal edema.

 2.  Findings suggestive of portal vein thrombosis involving one of the distal
 branches of the right portal vein with adjacent areas of hypoenhancement
 related to alteration in vascular flow.

 3.  Focal, eccentric thrombus involving one of the gastric varices.

 4.  No evidence of ascites.

 5.  No focal suspicious hepatic lesions.

 6.  Satisfactory appearance of the transplanted right pelvic kidney.

 7.  Multiple vertebral compression fractures.

 8. Non-obstructing calculus in the native left kidney.

   Assessment and Plan
   62F with admission for pneumonia developing into ARDS. Sputum and BAL
   showing MRSA at this point.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   ARDS in the setting of MRSA pneumonia. Possibility of other
   complicating factors; however, ANCA negative, [**Doctor First Name **] positive with titer
   only 1:80, HIV status unknown. Has been on a steroid taper. Has had a
   high sedation requirement due to vent dyssynchrony when sedation
   lightened. To address sedation difficulty and attempt to liberate from
   fentanyl and midaz drips we initiated methadone and diazepam IV;
   however, she is still requiring the fentanyl and versed drips though at
   reduced doses. Surveillance sputum culture from [**2191-4-8**] with rare MRSA
   growth.  Worsening peaks pressures this AM
   - Continue Vancomycin for MRSA, as Vanco level was 17.2 this AM, likely
   one additional dose of vancomycin today will complete her antibiotic
   course
   - Yesterday was last day of solumedrol
   - Will check PM lytes and begin diuresis with 10 mg IV furosemide if
   creatinine stable or continuing to improve
   - Continue fentanyl patch at 200mcg/hr
   - Continue methadone and diazepam titrated up as needed to allow
   liberation from fentanyl and midaz drips
   - Cont to follow oxygen sats and conservative ABG to guide ventilator
   settings, nebs PRN
   - Contact IP today to let them know that trach and PEG are within
   immediate future for this patient
   # DVT:
   Found to have L-IJ clot extending into subclavian. The line was removed
   however, the patient
s PTT was elevated initially without systemic
   anticoagulation.  Unclear if this rise in PTT is due only to heparin
   SC, however patient had previously normal PTT on this admission so
   unlikely to have suddenly developed a deficiency in a clotting factor
   unless poor nutritional status is now contributing. Currently unknown
   if PTT represents anticoagulation vs. hypercoaguable state. PTT today
   was 65.9.
   - F/U lupus anti-coagulant and anti-phospholipid antibodies studies
   - Cont to follow coags
   - Cont sq heparin for now, d/c if PTT supratherapeutic, start heparin
   drip at low rate today if PTT drops below 50 on evening PTT check
   # [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Likely multifactorial, differential for her [**Last Name (un) **] includes ATN (supported
   by appearance of muddy brown casts on sediment examination), CIN from
   recent dye exposure (however her Cr increased more quickly than
   expected after the contrast exposure), postrenal causes unlikely
   following renal U/S on [**2191-4-6**] without note of hydronephrosis or a
   combination of the above. Urine smear for eos was negative, however
   this has low sensitivity and specificity for AIN. Creatinine decreasing
   to 2.7 today.  Has had increasing UOP in the last 24 hours and
   auto-diuresed to negative fluid balance yesterday. Will  check PM lytes
   and I/O balance.
   - Renal consult following
   - Improved Cr today, will plan to initiate diuresis if creatinine on PM
   lytes check is stable or improved from this AM
   #Anemia:
   HCT of 22.2 on [**2191-4-9**] after steady downtrend during ICU course.
   Thought to be secondary to phlebotomy. Iron studies performed on
   [**2191-4-9**] and ferritin of 346 along with iron sat of 25% not consistent
   with iron deficiency anemia. Received 2 units pRBC
s with good response
   several days ago and is now essentially stable with HCT of 26.4 this
   AM. Per report, patient has history of pernicious anemia. B12 levels
   are WNL as of [**2191-4-11**].
   - Continue to trend
   # Hypotension/Hypertension:
   Balance has now swung that patient has recently been hypertensive. This
   likely either unmasked essential hypertension vs. incomplete sedation.
   Will allow some permissive hypertension in setting of [**Last Name (un) **] in order to
   allow adequate perfusion of kidneys given unknown relative normal [**Name2 (NI) 1056**]
   pressure exposure for kidneys.

  appearance of gastric pull-through.
 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  58-year-old man with fever, postop day 20 following right hepatic
 lobectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma.

 COMPARISON:  CT abdomen and pelvis [**2165-9-10**].

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT-acquired axial images were obtained through the abdomen and
 pelvis following administration of intravenous contrast material.  Multiplanar
 reformatted images were generated.

 CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  At the lung bases, there is a small right
 pleural effusion with associated atelectasis.  There is no consolidation.
 There is no left pleural effusion.  The heart is normal in size without
 pericardial effusion.

 In the abdomen, the patient is status post right hepatic partial lobectomy,
 with a surgical drain in a large fluid collection in the right upper quadrant,
 unchanged in position and configuration from the prior study.  Again, the
 collection contains low- density material and a single focus of air, with a
 thin enhancing margin of peritoneum. Overall, the collection now measures 9.1
 x 5.6 x 4.7 cm, previously 8.2 x 5.3 cm.  This is likely unchanged given
 technical differences in measurement. Surgical clips along the margin of this
 collection are unchanged.

 The remaining hepatic parenchyma enhances uniformly without worrisome focal
 lesions.  The portal vein is patent.  There is no intra- or extra-hepatic
 biliary ductal dilatation.  The pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands and duodenum
 are unremarkable.  The patient is post-esophageal resection with gastric pull-
 through, and this appearance is also stable.  Kidneys enhance and excrete
 contrast symmetrically without hydronephrosis or worrisome renal masses.
 Bilateral small renal hypodensities are again too small to characterize.  In

                                 FINAL REPORT
 (Cont)
 the interpolar region of the right kidney, there is a small, poorly enhancing
 focus, with a nonspecific appearance.

 The abdominal aorta and its major branches demonstrate mild atherosclerotic
 calcification, without dilatation.  The mesentery is diffusely, mildly
 increased in attenuation consistent with edema.  There is no free air or free
 fluid in the abdomen.

 CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  Overall, the colon is relatively collapsed,
 demonstrating mild, diffuse wall thickening, most suggestive of generalized
 edema. Mucosal enhancement is normal.  There is no small bowel abnormality.
 The urinary bladder, distal ureters, prostate gland, and rectum are
 unremarkable. There is no free fluid in the pelvis.  There is no pelvic,
 inguinal, mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy by size criteria.

 OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  There is no fracture or worrisome bony lesion.  Mild
 degenerative changes are noted in the thoracolumbar spine, with mild, grade 1
 retrolisthesis of L5 on S1.  Soft tissues again demonstrate a small
 subcutaneous fluid collection in the right anterior abdominal wall adjacent to
 the surgical incision, measuring 2.6 x 1.4 cm.  This demonstrates mild
 peripheral enhancement.  Subcutaneous tissues demonstrate diffuse anasarca.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  Stable fluid collection at the right hepatic resection margin with
 an enhancing periphery; surgical drain unchanged. Again, differential
 diagnosis includes biloma, resolving hematoma or abscess.

 2.  Stable small superficial fluid collection in the right anterior abdominal
 wall near the surgical incision site.

 3.  Small focus of relative hypoperfusion in the right kidney.  This is
 nonspecific, although pyelonephritis is not entirely excluded. Correlation
 with urinalysis is suggested.

 4.  Diffuse anasarca, mesenteric edema and mild colonic wall thickening
 consistent with generalized edema.  Colitis is not entirely excluded,
 however, and could be better assessed by stool examination given the
 confounding factor of generalized edema.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  MRI brain.

 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Patient with widespread metastatic disease, for further
 evaluation.

 TECHNIQUE:  T1 sagittal and axial FLAIR T2 susceptibility and diffusion axial
 images were obtained before gadolinium.  T1 axial and MP-RAGE sagittal images
 acquired following the administration of gadolinium.

 FINDINGS:  There are multiple foci of enhancement identified within the brain
 in the supra- and infratentorial region with the largest lesion in the
 parafalcine area in the right frontal lobe measuring approximately 1.5 cm.
 The other areas are about 1 cm and smaller in size.  Mild surrounding edema
 seen about these lesions and findings are consistent with metastatic disease.
 No evidence of blood products seen.  There is no midline shift identified.
 Diffuse white matter edema is seen in the supratentorial subcortical region.
 No acute infarcts are identified.

 IMPRESSION:  Findings are consistent with multiple brain metastases in the
 supra- and infratentorial region.  Mild surrounding edema seen.  No midline
 shift or hydrocephalus.

 PROVISIONAL FINDINGS IMPRESSION (PFI): JBK TUE [**2112-8-16**] 12:55 PM
  Gallstones, no biliary obstruction, limited Doppler suggests portal vein
  reversal of flow.
 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  52-year-old man with ETOH and obstructive hyperbilirubinemia,
 evaluate portal veins for thrombosis.

 COMPARISON:  No previous exams for comparison.

 FINDINGS:  The liver is diffusely echogenic consistent with fatty
 infiltration.  Because of the echogenicity of the liver, it is very difficult
 to evaluate the liver tissue for focal abnormalities.  There is no biliary
 obstruction seen.  Multiple tiny gallstones are identified within the neck of
 the gallbladder, but there are no signs of cholecystitis.  The midline
 structures are obscured by overlying bowel gas.  The spleen is unremarkable
 and measures 9.9 cm.  Both right and left kidneys demonstrate no
 hydronephrosis and no stones.  The right kidney measures 11.1 cm, and the left
 kidney measures 11.3 cm.  There is a trivial amount of ascites in the
 perihepatic space.

 DOPPLER EXAMINATION:  Note is made that due to the increased echogenicity of
 the liver, the Doppler exam is dramatically limited.  A single view of a
 portal vein within the liver demonstrates hepatofugal flow.  Appropriate flow
 is identified in the middle hepatic vein and the left hepatic vein.  The
 remainder of the blood vessels cannot be identified on this exam.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Very echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration.  Other forms of
 liver disease and more advanced liver disease including significant hepatic
 fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this study.
 2.  Multiple small gallstones and no signs of cholecystitis.
 3.  Extremely limited Doppler study which demonstrates reverse flow in a
 single intrahepatic portal vein.  Ultrasound cannot further evaluate the
 patency of the hepatic vessels.

 [**Hospital 2**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
    55 year old man with ESLD, cirrhosis on transplant list with increasing
  abdominal mass by MRI.
 REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
  Please perform liver bx after large volume paracentesis.
 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  End-stage liver disease, cirrhosis, liver mass on MRI.
 Biopsy needed.

 PROCEDURE:  Targeted liver biopsy with ultrasound guidance by Radiology.

 TECHNIQUE:

 After the procedural technique, benefits, and risks were explained to the
 patient, the patient gave written consent to proceed.  A site in the right
 upper quadrant was determined for access to the liver lesion and marked on the
 skin.  Preprocedure timeout was performed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 554**] present.  Right upper
 quadrant was prepared and draped in usual sterile fashion and 1% lidocaine was
 administered over capsule.  Small skin [**Doctor Last Name 111**] was made and using an ultrasound
 guide, an 18-gauge core biopsy needle was inserted under ultrasound guidance
 into the lesion two times with two biopsy samples obtained.  Biopsies were
 sent to Pathology for analysis.  Hemostasis was achieved after the second
 biopsy.  There were no immediate complications.

 The patient received moderate sedation with a nurse trained in conscious
 sedation present for the entire procedure.  The patient received two doses of
 fentanyl for a total of 75 mcg and two doses of Versed for a total of 1.5 mg,
 both intravenously.  Total intraservice time with hemodynamic parameters
 continuously monitored was 40 minutes.  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 923**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 554**], attending
 radiologist, was present for the entire procedure.

 FINDINGS:

 Redemonstrated is the slightly indistinct hyperechoic area within segment VIII
 of the liver in the location of the mass seen on MRI.  Subsequent images show
 needles within the lesion.  Incidental note was also made of increased biliary
 ductal dilatation peripheral to the lesion within the right and left
 lateral hepatic lobes, which had increased since [**2117-2-25**] ultrasound.

 IMPRESSION:

 Successful ultrasound-guided targeted biopsy of segment VIII liver lesion.

   Will aggressively give KCL today and continue Diamox; recheck lytes q6h
   (K, NA, HCO3)
   -          aggressively give KCL, goal K > 4.5
   -          presistant met alk despite stopping lasix suggests an
   additional reason.  Likely [**3-5**] GI losses ( hight PEG output)

 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   Pt with severe cardiomyopathy and EF of only 10%.
   -Continue Digoxin at current dose; although pt not tolerating PO in
   setting of ? SBO/blocked G tube thus will give IV Metoprolol until PO
   can be resumed
   -Changed from Metoprolol to Carvedilol per Cardiology; will restart
   when tolerating PO
   -Appears euvolemic if not dry on exam; thus holding lasix for now
 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   -WBC scan unremarkable, HIV negative
   -Continued fever today , sputum cultures grew GPC and now covering with

   #COAGULOPATHY - possible sources since the last coumadin was given on

   and episodic hypotension, however would expect higher LFTs if cause was
   ischemia. Of note LFT are elevated. Nutrition possible since no Vit K
   in tube feeds but near normal alb. a source could be levaquin, as this
   effects coumadin metabolism. DIC unlikely since platelets are rising.

Patient Disposition: Full code

Neuro: Patient is A/Ox2. Patient is able to move all extremities. During the night had to apply soft restraints to prevent patient from pulling foley and PIV access out. We have since d/c'd restraints, patients compliance has improved.

CV: Patient remains in Afib with controlled ventricular response of 70-80's, with occassional PVC's. Gave 40 mEq of KCL for a potassium of 3.1, and gave 2 grams of Mg for a magnesium level of 1.7.

Resp: Early in shift RR was in high 30's to 40's. NTS x1 for moderate amounts of sputum. Since have been able to wean cool neb of 50% to 35%, and presently on 3L nasal canula due to noncompliance with face tent. Patient has not required NTS since last eve, have been able to elicit good cough with yankaur for thick yellow sputum. Lung sounds are coarse throughout. Administered CPT multiple times with good effect.

GI/GU: NPO/PEG still clamped. +BS, BM x2-melena. Abdomen soft. Foley is intact and draining bloody urine d/t patient pulling at foley multiple times.

Skin: Heels have necrotic pressure sores. Left anterior foot has blister, covered with dsd. Buttocks were found to be reddened, turned multiple times to decrease pressure on coccyx.

Social: Patient and nephew spoke to MD this shift regarding plan of care.

Plan: Continue to administer CPT, encourage cough and deep breathing, elicite cough and sputum production with yankaur, and suction with NTS when necessary. Monitor O2 sat's and respiratory status. Monitor Afib, PVC's and Lytes. Replinsh when appropriate. ? need for air matress to reduce pressure on legs/buttocks/feet.
